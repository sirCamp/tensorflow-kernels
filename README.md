# Tensorflow-kernels
A package with Tensorflow (both CPU and GPU) implementation of most popular Kernels for kernels methods (SVM, MKL...).

Those kernels works with tensor as inputs. Shortly I will develop a small utils in order to convert np arrays to tensors and viceversa the kernel methods output to an np.array.

The main idea of this project is to exploit the powerfull of GPUs and modern CPUs on matrix and kernels elaborations.
Actually the implemented kernels are:


+ Linear
+ RBF
+ Polynomial
+ CosineSimilarity
+ Fourier
+ Spline

# Example: 
I will add a simple example


# Credits:
The idea was born by using methods available here: [https://github.com/gmum/pykernels](https://github.com/gmum/pykernels)
